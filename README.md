# Oluwaseun Muyiwa - Data Analyst Portfolio

This is my professional data analytics portfolio website, built to showcase my skills and projects — including my 10Alytics Capstone Project: *NovaMed Solutions – Sales Performance Analysis and Reporting*.

## 🚀 How to Host on GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub profile: [github.com/moschinez](https://github.com/moschinez)
2. Create a new repository named **moschinez.github.io**
3. Upload the contents of this folder (index.html, style.css, and /images folder)
4. Commit the changes.
5. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set the branch to **main**.
6. Wait 1–2 minutes, then visit **https://moschinez.github.io**

## 🖼️ Updating Dashboard Images

Replace the images inside the `/images` folder with your real Power BI dashboard screenshots.
Keep the same file names (`dashboard1.png`, `dashboard2.png`, `dashboard3.png`) or update the HTML references.
